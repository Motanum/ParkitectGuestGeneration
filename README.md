--==Parkitect Guest Generation==--

This program will generate a file in the exe's location. Such file named 'GuestName.txt' will contain the
code necesary to be pasted inside the savegame file in your parkitect folder. 

For exe, simply download directly from my dropbox. Might require some extra DLLs as it's compiled with Visual Studio

How to use
1. Open up the savegame you want to add the guests to.
2. Go to the end, and see the last Guest ID.
3. Open up the program and follow the instructions there.
4. ID must be unique, you can try starting with 5000. For very big parks maybe you need a bigger ID.
5. Tell the program how many clones you want in the end
6. Set the name of ALL guests
7. Set the vbarious properties.
    Variance means the +- values for all properties. For example, if set at 0.2 and a property is set to
    0.5 then, the possible values are from 0.3 to 0.7. Values will be clamped out from 0 to 1 at the end.
    
8. Open the GuestName.txt file which is in the location of the exe.
9. Copy all the code there into your save game at the end.
10. Be sure to not have any empty line at the end
11. Load up your game and enjoy your new peeps!
